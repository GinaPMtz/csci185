1. What corrections did you have to make?

I would have to add image descriptions, and additional text support (for people with visibility disabilities I believe)
I wuld also need to add labels to some of the text boxes, because otherwise the computer cannot tell what they are supposed
to be used for.

1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

No, because the CSS is what designed most of the page, so if I turn it off it would look widely different and that would
make it less readable

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

By using the space bar, you can move from section to section. however, it does not allow for the buttons or certain links to work.



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
